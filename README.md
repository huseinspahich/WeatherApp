# WeatherApp
A current weather and forecast web app, based on data from https://www.OpenWeatherMapAPI.com
This application allows users to access current weather details for different locations around the world.
Working on this project,I deepened my understanding of Public API and Axios. 
API of my choice was OpenWeather. It was a great experience that taught me how to utilize APIs and made me a more skilled developer.
I also use this project to exercise JavaScript (NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS), HTML&CSS.
